 *
 * The values below are duplicated from `lib/deepLinks.ts` rather than imported:
 * Expo transpiles this file on its own and then `require`s it, so a relative
 * import of a sibling TypeScript module fails to resolve at config-load time.
 * `lib/__tests__/appConfig.test.ts` asserts the two stay in agreement — the
 * config and the resolver drifting apart is exactly how deep links break
 * silently.
 *
 * Universal links additionally require the two verification files served by the
 * wallet web app from `frontend/wallet/public/.well-known/`; see
 * `frontend/mobile/README.md` for the values to fill in before a store build.
