/**
 * The activity feed's duplicate rules.
 *
 * One payment can reach this feed twice, from two sources with two different
 * ids: the contract's SAC transfer event and the fee-payer's classic Horizon
 * payment. Which of the two wins changes between polls, because the classic leg
 * is indexed a moment after the event — so a feed keyed on row id keeps both
 * and the user sees a single transfer listed twice.
 *
 * The opposite mistake is just as visible: keying on the transaction hash alone
 * collapses a bulk payout, which is one transaction carrying many payments, into
 * a single row.
