/**
 * Spending the smart wallet's OWN funds — the `__check_auth` path.
 *
 * A transfer out of the C-address is a native-SAC `transfer(from=C, to, amount)`
 * whose address credential must be authorised by the wallet contract itself:
 * the passkey signs the Soroban authorization preimage and `__check_auth`
 * verifies that WebAuthn signature on-chain. `signXdrPayload` (lib/walletConnect)
 * already implements the whole ceremony — recording-mode simulate, passkey-sign
 * each auth entry, enforce-mode re-simulate, fee-payer wrap — so this module
 * just builds the unsigned transfer and routes it through.
