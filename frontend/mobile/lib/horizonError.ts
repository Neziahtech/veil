/**
 * Plain English for a rejected Stellar transaction.

 * about where to find documentation, and whose useful half is a set of short
 * codes buried at `extras.result_codes`. Shown raw it is a wall of JSON with an
 * XDR blob in the middle — which is what a user saw when a swap failed.
 *
 * The codes are the part worth reading, so this turns them into a sentence that
 * says what went wrong and what would fix it. Anything unrecognised falls back
 * to the code itself, which is still shorter and more searchable than the
 * document that carried it.
