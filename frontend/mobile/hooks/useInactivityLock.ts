 * Locks the wallet after inactivity or when the app is backgrounded, so a lost
 * or borrowed phone doesn't expose funds.
 *
 * The countdown lives in `lib/appLock.ts`; this hook wires it to React Native's
 * `AppState` and expo-router. Sending the app to the background locks it
 * immediately; returning to the foreground restarts the idle countdown. Either
 * trigger routes to `/lock`, which re-prompts a biometric and then returns to
 * the screen the lock covered (lib/lockReturn.ts). It re-arms itself off the
 * current route so it never fights the lock screen it just pushed.
 *
 * The lock only arms once a wallet exists. Before then there is nothing to
 * protect, and `/lock` would be a dead end — there is no passkey to unlock with —
 * so an onboarding user must never be sent there. (This is also what stops a
 * fresh install from being trapped on the lock screen the moment Expo Go hands
 * off to the project and fires an `AppState` background event.)
 *
 * Mount once at the app root (alongside the connectivity gate in `_layout.tsx`).
